# Contributing Guidelines

## Reporting Bugs

To report a bug, please file an issue on this Github repository, using the "Bug report" option. This should be reserved for reporting bugs and defects in end-user functionality.

When filing issues, we need to see details about what the problem is, what steps need to be taken to reproduce the problem, and what you expect the behavior to be. Since the software makes heavy use of different role types, one piece of data that should generally be included in the reproduction steps is what role encountered the problem (e.g. student, instructor, editor). It might be helpful to copy the following and use it as a template when writing up an issue:

```
